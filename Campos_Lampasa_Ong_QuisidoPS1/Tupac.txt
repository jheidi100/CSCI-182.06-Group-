Oh you too, nigga
Don't think we ain't talking about your punk ass
You ol' fake ass nigga

Here we go
Turn it up let it start
From block to block we snatchin hearts
And jackin' marks
And the punk police can't fade me
You made me
Crooked-ass beast something daisy

But right now
I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine
Get up
Cause it's time to make that pay back
Fact
And my brothas on the block better stay strapped
Black

And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth
Tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
Case you can't see
This what we burned the other week -uh
Primis Player Placeholder
Now we go him in the smash - blast
How long will it last until the po' get mo' cash?
Until then, RAISE up
To my young black males, BLAZE up

Life's a mess
Don't stress - test
Or give in
But be thankful that you livin bless
Much love to my brothas in the Pen
See ya when I free ya
Not when they shove me in


Thug for life
High till I die
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin' it fly

Tell 'em

Thug for life
High till I die
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin 'it fly
Tell 'em

Thug for life
High till I die
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin' it fly

Tell 'em

Thug for life
High till I die
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin 'it fly

Pump your fists like this
Holla if you hear me
Pump pump if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin it up
One way or another you'll be givin' it up - hugh

I guess cause I'm black-born
I'm supposed to say "peace" sing songs and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan - BAMN!
I'll be swingin like a one man klan


Thug for life
High till I die
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin' it fly
Tell 'em

Thug for life
High till I die
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin 'it fly
